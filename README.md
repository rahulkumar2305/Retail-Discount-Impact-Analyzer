# Retail-Discount-Impact-Analyzer
**Ratail Discount Impact Analyzer**   This project analyzes the impact of discounts on product sales and revenue trends. It helps retailers make informed decision about their discount strategies.
The Retail Discount Impact Analyzer is a data-driven solution that empowers retailers to optimize their discount strategies through comprehensive analysis. This project addresses the critical business challenge of uninformed discounting by systematically measuring how price reductions affect both sales volume and overall revenue.

Using sales data containing product prices, discount percentages, and quantity sold before and after discounts, the tool calculates precise revenue impacts across product portfolios. It generates intuitive visualizations that highlight patterns and outliers, revealing which discounts drive profitability and which undermine revenue. The system categorizes products based on performance and provides actionable recommendationsâ€”whether to increase, maintain, reduce, or eliminate discounts.

Beyond analysis, the solution exports detailed reports with executive summaries, product-level insights, and specific strategic guidance. This enables retailers to make evidence-based pricing decisions that maximize profitability while maintaining competitive positioning. The tool transforms discount management from guesswork to strategic advantage, ultimately improving bottom-line performance through data-informed discount optimization.
